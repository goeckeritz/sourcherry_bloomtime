#this might be because we've better accounted for the genotype-specific variation in this model.
#But how to know which model is 'better'?
#one thing is for certain: that high Pr(>Chisq) for bloom*chill factor indicates the genotypes are responding more or less the same across time points.
#which I find.. interesting.
#makes me wonder if chill sensing (if ros content is indeed a proxy for it) doesn't really depend on 
#development as they enter dormancy. More research needed!

#I definitely want to explicitly partition the variation within genotype (a random effect). So my gut says to go with this second model...

#so, according to these results, the comparison p values are:
#6.6 v 26.6 portions = 0.000109 (the umoles of H2O2 per gram of fresh weight is significantly higher at 26.6 portions - which is the deep endodormancy most assuredly; 6.6 portions, there were still leaves and the flower buds were still actively developing).
#6.6 v 43.7 potions = 0.041 (the umoles of H2O2 per gram of fresh weight is significantly lower at 6.6 chill portions compared to 43.7 chill portions)
#no statistical difference for 6.6 and 74.8 chill portions
#ditto for 6.6 and 93.4.
#26.6 vs 74.8 portions = 0.0000084 - significantly higher H2O2 at 26.6 portions. 
#26.6 vs 93.4 = 0.0000018 - significantly higher H2O2 at 26.6 portions. 
#43.7 vs 74.8 chill portions = 0.011 - significantly higher H2O2 at 43.7 chill portions. 
#43.7 vs 93.4 = 0.0036 - significantly higher H2O2 at 43.7 chill portions. 
#no statistical difference between 74.8 and 93.4.

#I'd like plot mean values and color them by bloom group; for that, I need to make a model where
#genotype is a fixed effect. No need to reset the data here - only 8 observations were dropped anyway.
