#the dataaaaa
#real simple -- i wanna make a plot with both years on it, as well as separate years. 
#do year as shape, and different shades of blue for earlies and different shades of pink for lates. 
#update 11/1/2023 - Rebecca recommended doing a Mann-Whitney test fo our discrete staging data. Data can't be
#normal since it's discrete. We do have an ordinal measurement scale too. https://www.statisticssolutions.com/free-resources/directory-of-statistical-analyses/mann-whitney-u-test/

##Mann-Whitney tests by date...

#2018-2019:
#Goal: at pre-dormancy dates, do early stages and late stages come from the same distribution? I.e.,
#are they statistically different from one another? Not sure I can do Nesting here. Found this: https://rdrr.io/cran/nestedRanksTest/man/nestedRanksTest.html
#But I might blow the code up if I use an ordinal dependent. The description seems to fit the data.

#we'll test dates 220, 263, and 303.(August 8, Sep 20, Oct 30) --- Excluding Jun14 cuz... duh, they're all at the same stage. 

Aug8_2018 = data_2018 %>%

Oct30_2018 = data_2018 %>%
  dplyr::filter(data_2018$julian_day==303)

  dplyr::filter(data_2018$julian_day==332)

#After some discussion with Andrea, we decided -- although it's not optimal -- that we'd treat each flower bud as an independent observation for 
#each bloom group, because there isn't an easy way with the Mann-Whitney test to control for the random effect of each tree. 
#The only other option I could come up with was test the medians of each tree for each date... but that would completely destroy my
#statistical power, to the point that it's likely not worth to do. 

#so, we'll do it as described and consider a bonferroni correction for multiple tests. Let's start with 2018-19
#We've 4 dates to test: 
#Aug8, Sep20, and Oct30

#Then we'll do 2019-2020. We have X dates to test:
#Jul18, Aug8, Aug22, Sep9, Nov13

#Question... do I have to coerce my ordinal data into an integer? Is that... okay??
#"While both are nonparametric and involve summation of ranks, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test requires that the data is paired while the Wilcoxon rank-sum test is used for unpaired data."
#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test#Ordinal_data

#this example seems pretty similar to mine, and these guys just willy nilly start treating the data as numeric
#with no EFFING EXPLANATION: https://rcompanion.org/handbook/F_04.html
#Lord of all statistics, WHY???
#In general I can say that there is some numerical value to the stagings, sure -- 1 < 2 < 3.... etc.
#But I'm definitely not confident about saying the difference between 1 and 2 is the same as the difference between 2 and 3. 
#I'll treat it as numeric and consult the co-authors.
