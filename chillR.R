#First, download the temperature data and get it into the format described in 'chillR documentation.pdf'

#Install and load the package and its dependencies

#install.packages('chillR') 
#Everything properly downloaded - huzzah!


#Read in the data. I downloaded it from Clarksville's enviroweather. Temp is in C. Some editing was done in excel to get the date in that format, and the hours were changes in a text editer using regular expressions. 

data <- read.csv("oct1_2017_to_feb26_2022.csv", header=T)
str(data)
#Need to change the JDay to Julian Day of that year. It probably shouldn't be a factor either but we'll find out soon enough. 
#This package I found on Stack Overflow; let's see if I can get it to work and replace my current JDay column
#install.packages('lubridate')

require(lubridate)
require(chillR)
require(tidyverse)

data2 <- data %>%
  mutate(JDay = yday(JDay)) # you MUST CHANGE YOUR DATE TO YEAR-MON-DAY before this works, and have it open in excel, because it auto changes back the date format. God fuck excel. 
#Did it work?
head(data2)

#Yes! Now I need to make sure that each of the 4 variables 
#(columns) are the right kind of class.  
?chilling
?stack_hourly_temps
#I need to see an example data set that stack_hourly_temps produces
weather<-fix_weather(KA_weather[which(KA_weather$Year>2004),])
hourtemps<-stack_hourly_temps(weather, latitude=50.4)
str(hourtemps)
#Ah, so this is a list with two elements: hourtemps, and QC. Looks like Year is an integer, JDay is a num, Hour is num but I may have it in the wrong format initially (have 01 but should start with 0), and Temp is numeric. So all numeric except Year.
