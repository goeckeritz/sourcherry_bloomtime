#WGCNA requires input values as FPKM, so we gotta pull that information from the Stringtie output table for each library (-A option). If we paste the columns together
#in a known order, I can add a header with the library names. 

#First, we'll need to run the quantification script but also ask stringtie to output a table with the -A option. I submitted this as an array job. 
#according to our PCAs for DESeq2, 27-04-34's 6/12/19 rep is an outlier -- something about mapping these all to subgenomeA really fucked this guy up. So, we 
#will exclude him in the WGCNA analysis. 

#To get the .table output from stringtie, see this script: 
#/Users/Goeckeritz/Desktop/Desktop - Charityâ€™s MacBook Pro/cherry_stuff_Charity/RNAseq_summer2019_bloom_analysis/StringTie2_subA_relaxed_gene_level_fpkm_for_WGCNA_analysis.sh

#then sort each output table by the Gene ID, just in case the genes are reported in a different order among the files. 
#go to the directory where the table files are and do... 


#!/bin/sh

for i in $(ls -1 *fpkm); do
	sed '1d' $i | sort -k1 > $(echo $i)_sorted
done

#might be worth extracting a few of the Gene ID columns and comparing them to be sure they are exactly the same -- I just did that skimming the rows in a few files and making sure
#every file had the same # of lines. They looked good. 

########## Now, we can extract the column of interest from each file (FPKM, or column 8) 

#!/bin/sh

for i in $(ls -1 *fpkm_sorted); do
	awk -F '\t' '{print $8}' $i > $(echo $i | sed 's/_QTL_round2_4fpkm_sorted//' | sed 's/_cleaned//' | sed 's/b//')_FPKM
done

#then, we can paste stuff together

paste $(echo `ls -1 *FPKM | tr "\n" "\t"`) > pasted_FPKMs

#remove first line and replace it with the header. Should be echoed in the same order. Then add the gene ids back in. 

#sed '1d' pasted_FPKMs > tmp
ls -1 *FPKM | tr "\n" "\t" | sed 's/ /\t/' > header
sed -i 's/\t$/\n/g' header
cat header pasted_FPKMs > tmp2
awk '{print $1}' 27-04-34_7_18_19_R3_cleaned_QTL_round2_4fpkm_sorted > sorted_gene_list 
##GO IN AND ADD Gene_ID TO THE FIRST LINE OF THE SORTED GENE LIST IF YOU ARE WORKING WITH WEIRD NAMES. 
paste sorted_gene_list tmp2 > RNAseq_bloom_2019_FPKM.table

#note, I went into the final file and changed Gene to Gene_ID
#after I put the table on my local computer, I opened it up in BBedit to check the column order was correct. 
#I checked the first 4 columns, and the last 2, and all is well. :)
